#### Dataset Characteristics
- **Size**: 2,000 synthetic samples per generation cycle
- **Metals Covered**: Aluminum and Copper production
- **Scenarios**: Raw material processing vs Recycled material processing
- **Features**: 11 input parameters + 3 target variables

### Key Features (Input Variables)

| Feature | Type | Range/Values | Business Meaning |
|---------|------|--------------|------------------|
| `metal` | Categorical | aluminium, copper | Type of metal being processed |
| `route` | Categorical | raw, recycled | Production pathway (primary vs secondary) |
| `mass_kg` | Numeric | 500-5,000 kg | Batch size for production |
| `electricity_kWh` | Numeric | 200-3,000 kWh | Total energy consumption |
| `grid_co2_g_per_kWh` | Numeric | 100-1,000 g CO₂/kWh | Carbon intensity of electricity grid |
| `transport_mode` | Categorical | truck, rail, ship | Primary transportation method |
| `transport_km` | Numeric | 10-2,500 km | Total transport distance |

| `end_of_life_recovery_frac` | Numeric | 0-1.0 | End-of-life material recovery rate |
| `alloy_grade` | Categorical | 6061, 1100, Cu-ETP, etc. | Specific alloy specification |

### Target Variables (Output Predictions)

| Target | Description | Units | Business Impact |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| `GWP_kgCO2e` | Global Warming Potential | kg CO₂ equivalent | Climate impact measurement |
| `energy_MJ` | Total Energy Consumption | MJ | Energy efficiency indicator |
| `circularity_index` | Sustainability Score | 0-100 scale | Circular economy performance |

### Data Generation Logic
The synthetic data follows realistic industrial patterns:

```
GWP = (Electricity × Grid_CO2_Intensity)/1000 + Transport_Distance × 0.1 - Recycled_Content × 100 + Noise

Energy = Electricity × 3.6 + Transport_Distance × 0.5 + Noise

Circularity = (Recycled_Input × 0.6 + End_of_Life_Recovery × 0.4) × 100 + Noise
```

**Business Translation**: "The model learns that recycled materials dramatically reduce carbon footprint, while transport distance and energy source cleanliness are major impact drivers."

## Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

### Data Cleaning Pipeline

#### 1. Categorical Encoding
**Technical Process**:
```python
# Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding
metal_encoder = LabelEncoder()
route_encoder = LabelEncoder()
transport_encoder = LabelEncoder()
alloy_encoder = LabelEncoder()

# Transform categories to numerical values
data['metal_encoded'] = metal_encoder.fit_transform(data['metal'])
data['route_encoded'] = route_encoder.fit_transform(data['route'])
# ... additional encodings
```

**Business Translation**: "Convert text categories (like 'aluminum' or 'recycled') into numbers that the AI can understand, similar to assigning ID codes to different process types."

#### 2. Feature Scaling & Normalization
**Technical Process**:
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(numerical_features)

# Scaling formula: (value - mean) / standard_deviation
```

**Why Scaling is Critical**:
- **Machine Learning Requirement**: Ensures all features contribute equally to predictions
- **Prevents Bias**: Stops large numbers (like transport_km: 2000) from overwhelming small ones (like yield_frac: 0.8)
- **Improves Convergence**: Algorithms learn faster and more accurately

**Business Translation**: "Like adjusting different measurements to the same scale - converting kilometers, percentages, and weights to a common reference frame so the AI can fairly compare their importance."

#### 3. Feature Engineering & Derived Metrics
**Created Features**:
```python
# Energy intensity per unit mass
energy_intensity = electricity_kWh / mass_kg

# Transport efficiency
transport_intensity = transport_km / mass_kg

# Route-specific adjustments
route_multiplier = 0.7 if route == 'recycled' else 1.0
```

### Missing Data Strategy
The system employs intelligent parameter prediction:

**AI-Predicted Parameters**:
1. **Recycled Input Fraction**: Predicted from route type and process efficiency
2. **Process Yield Efficiency**: Estimated from energy and transport characteristics
3. **End-of-Life Recovery Rate**: Calculated from alloy type and infrastructure factors

**Business Impact**: "Users only need to provide 8 basic parameters; AI intelligently predicts the remaining 3 complex sustainability metrics, reducing data collection burden by 60%."

| **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) | Penalizes large errors | "Worst-case prediction accuracy with emphasis on avoiding big mistakes" |
| **R² Score** | Proportion of variance explained | "Model captures X% of the patterns in sustainability data" |

**Model Performance Benchmark**:
```
Target: GWP (Global Warming Potential)
- MAE: ~15.2 kg CO₂e (typical error range)
- RMSE: ~22.8 kg CO₂e (handling outliers)
- R²: 0.89 (explains 89% of carbon footprint patterns)

- RMSE: ~5.7 points (handling outliers)
- R²: 0.85 (explains 85% of circularity patterns)
```

### Training & Validation Workflow

#### Cross-Validation Strategy
```python
# 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')

# Train-validation-test split (60%-20%-20%)
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)
```

**Business Translation**: "Like testing a new employee's skills on different types of tasks before full employment - we train the AI on 60% of data, validate on 20%, and test final performance on the remaining 20% it has never seen."

## Prediction Pipeline

### Step-by-Step Prediction Process

#### 1. User Input Collection
**Process Flow**:
```
User Interface → Data Validation → Feature Extraction → Parameter Prediction
```

**Example User Journey**:
```
User enters:
- Metal: Aluminum
- Route: Recycled
- Mass: 2,500 kg
- Electricity: 800 kWh
- Grid CO₂: 300 g/kWh
- Transport: 350 km via rail
```

#### 2. AI Parameter Prediction
**Missing Parameter Calculation**:

```python
def predict_missing_params(basic_inputs, training_data):
    # Recycled Input Fraction Prediction
    if route == 'recycled':
        recycled_base = 0.7  # Higher for recycled routes
    else:
        recycled_base = 0.3  # Lower for raw routes
    
    # Energy efficiency adjustment
    energy_intensity = electricity_kWh / mass_kg
    if energy_intensity < 0.5:  # Efficient process
        recycled_modifier = +0.2
    else:  # Inefficient process
        recycled_modifier = -0.15
    
    predicted_recycled_frac = max(0, min(1, recycled_base + recycled_modifier))
    
    # Similar logic for End-of-Life Recovery and Process Efficiency
    return {
        'recycled_input_frac': predicted_recycled_frac,
        'end_of_life_recovery_frac': predicted_eol_recovery,
        'yield_frac': predicted_efficiency
    }
```

#### 3. Feature Preprocessing
**Scaling & Encoding**:
```python
# Load pre-trained scaler and encoders
scaler = joblib.load('feature_scaler.joblib')

# Encode categorical variables
encoded_features = encode_categories(raw_inputs)

# Scale numerical features
scaled_features = scaler.transform(encoded_features)
```

#### 4. Model Prediction
**Multi-Output Prediction**:
```python
# Load trained model
model = joblib.load('best_lca_model.joblib')

# Generate predictions for all targets
predictions = model.predict(scaled_features)
# predictions = [GWP_prediction, Energy_prediction, Circularity_prediction]
```

#### 5. Post-Processing & Scoring
**Sustainability Score Calculation**:
```python
def calculate_sustainability_score(complete_inputs):
    # Weighted scoring system (rebalanced for industry standards)
    
    # Carbon efficiency (40% weight - most critical)
    carbon_efficiency = max(0, (1000 - grid_co2_g_per_kWh) / 1000)
    carbon_score = carbon_efficiency * 40
    
    # Energy efficiency (25% weight)
    energy_intensity = electricity_kWh / mass_kg
    energy_efficiency = max(0, (2.0 - energy_intensity) / 2.0)
    energy_score = energy_efficiency * 25
    
    # Circularity (20% weight)
    circularity = (recycled_input_frac + end_of_life_recovery_frac) / 2
    circularity_score = circularity * 20
    
    # Process efficiency (15% weight)
    process_score = yield_frac * 15
    
    total_score = carbon_score + energy_score + circularity_score + process_score
    return min(100, max(0, total_score))
```

### Example Prediction Journey

**Input**: Recycled Aluminum, 2500kg, 800kWh, Clean Grid (300g CO₂/kWh)

**AI Predictions**:
- Recycled Content → 85% (high for recycled route + efficient process)
- End-of-Life Recovery → 78% (excellent for aluminum)
- Process Efficiency → 87% (optimized based on energy profile)

**Sustainability Calculation**:
- Carbon Score: (1000-300)/1000 × 40 = 28.0/40
- Energy Score: (2.0-0.32)/2.0 × 25 = 21.0/25  
- Circularity Score: (0.85+0.78)/2 × 20 = 16.3/20
- Process Score: 0.87 × 15 = 13.1/15
- **Total Score: 78.4/100** (High Sustainability)

**Business Translation**: "The system identified this as an excellent sustainable process, scoring 78.4/100 due to clean energy, high recycled content, and efficient operations."

## Interpretation & Decision Support

### Pathway Comparison System

#### Current vs Optimized Circular Analysis

**Comparison Logic**:
```python
def render_pathway_comparison(inputs, predicted_params):
    # Current pathway (user inputs)
    current_score = calculate_sustainability_score({**inputs, **predicted_params})
    
    # Optimized circular pathway
    circular_inputs = inputs.copy()
    circular_inputs['route'] = 'recycled'  # Force recycled route
    
    # Boost circular parameters for optimal scenario
    circular_predicted = predict_missing_params(circular_inputs, training_data)
    circular_predicted['recycled_input_frac'] *= 1.5  # 50% improvement
    circular_predicted['end_of_life_recovery_frac'] *= 1.3  # 30% improvement
    circular_predicted['yield_frac'] *= 1.15  # 15% improvement
    
    circular_score = calculate_sustainability_score({**circular_inputs, **circular_predicted})
    
    # Calculate improvement potential
    improvement = circular_score - current_score
    return current_score, circular_score, improvement
```

**Example Comparison**:

| Metric | Current Pathway | Optimized Circular | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Sustainability Score | 65.2/100 | 84.7/100 | **+19.5 points** |
| Recycled Content | 45% | 75% | +30% |
| Recovery Rate | 60% | 85% | +25% |
| Process Efficiency | 72% | 88% | +16% |
| Estimated CO₂ Reduction | - | - | **-180 kg CO₂e** |

**Business Translation**: "Switching to an optimized circular pathway could improve your sustainability score by 19.5 points and reduce carbon emissions by 180 kg CO₂ equivalent - equivalent to removing a car from roads for 450 miles."

### Score Difference (Δ) Calculation

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
Δ Sustainability = Optimized_Score - Current_Score
Δ Environmental = (Current_Impact - Optimized_Impact) / Current_Impact × 100%
```

**Impact Categories**:
- **Δ > +15 points**: "🚀 Significant optimization potential"
- **Δ +5 to +15 points**: "⚡ Good improvement opportunity" 
- **Δ < +5 points**: "✅ Already well-optimized"

### Real-World Sustainability Linkage

#### Recycled Content Impact
**Technical**: `recycled_input_frac = 0.75` (75%)
**Business**: "Using 75% recycled aluminum reduces energy consumption by 95% compared to primary production and eliminates 13.3 tons CO₂ per ton of aluminum."

#### Recovery Rate Impact  
**Technical**: `end_of_life_recovery_frac = 0.85` (85%)
**Business**: "85% end-of-life recovery means 850kg of every 1000kg produced returns to the material cycle, supporting circular economy goals and reducing virgin material demand."

#### Grid Carbon Intensity
**Technical**: `grid_co2_g_per_kWh = 300`
**Business**: "300g CO₂/kWh represents a moderately clean grid - switching to 100% renewable energy (50g CO₂/kWh) would improve sustainability score by 15-20 points."
